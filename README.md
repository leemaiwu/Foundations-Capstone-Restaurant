Welcome to Restaurant- where dining is reimagined. You can order any meal you'd like through Restaurant.

Restaurant is a web app created by Laura Wu as a Project while she attended Devmountain. In her perfect world, this restaurant would exist. There is no menu at Restaurant because the chefs are able to prepare anything you’d like.

Head back to the home page to place an order by filling out the form.

Once submitted, you can view your order below. This eatery is named ‘Restaurant’, but if you think you have a better name, send it over by submitting it in the field! I’d love to hear your ideas. When you click submit, it sends your suggestion to my bit.io database with an axios post request. Using Sequelize, I made sure to sanitize all input fields. This footer is also on the menu page.
