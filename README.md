Restaurant is a web app created by Laura Wu while she attended Devmountain. The concept behind Restaurant is to provide customers with a personalized dining experience by allowing them to order any meal they desire. There is no pre-determined menu, as our chefs are prepared to create any dish based on your preferences.

## How to Order
To place an order, simply fill out the form located on the home page after clicking 'Order'. All fields are required, and you may choose from any meal, side, or dessert. You can then select a drink from the drop-down menu and indicate whether you would like your order for 'Dine In' or 'To Go'. If you select 'To Go', a drop-down menu will appear for you to choose a pickup time frame.

Once you have submitted your order, you can view it below in the 'Recently Placed Orders' section.

Also, if you have any suggestions for the restaurant's name, please submit it in the field at the bottom of the page. I would love to hear your ideas! When you submit a name, your suggestion is sent to a bit.io database with an axios post request. Using Sequelize, I made sure to sanitize all input fields to ensure data security.
