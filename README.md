# Restaurant

Welcome to Restaurant- where dining is reimagined. You can order any meal you'd like!

Restaurant is a web app created by Laura Wu while she attended Devmountain. In her perfect world, this restaurant would exist. There is no menu at Restaurant because the chefs are able to prepare anything you’d like.

Head back to the home page to place an order by filling out the form. All fields are required, but you can order any meal/side or dessert then select from the drink drop down menu. Choose whethere you'd like to place this or for 'Dine In' or 'To Go'. If you choose 'To Go', a drop down menu will appear for you to select a pickup time frame.

Once submitted, you can view your order below. Also, this eatery is named ‘Restaurant’, but if you think you have a better name, send it over by submitting it in the field at the bottom of the page. I’d love to hear your ideas! When you click submit, it sends your suggestion to my bit.io database with an axios post request. Using Sequelize, I made sure to sanitize all input fields. This footer is also on the menu page.
